<h1 id="constitution-of-a-charitable-incorporated-organisation-with-voting-members-other-than-its-charity-trustees">Constitution of a Charitable Incorporated Organisation with voting members other than its charity trustees</h1>
<h2 id="association-model-constitution">('Association' Model Constitution)</h2>
<p>Date of constitution (last amended): 5th February 2013.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Name</p>
<p>The name of the Charitable Incorporated Organisation (&quot;the CIO&quot;) is So Make It.</p></li>
<li><p>National location of principal office</p>
<p>The CIO must have a principal office in England or Wales. The principal office of the CIO is in England.</p></li>
<li><p>Objects</p>
<p>The object of the CIO is for the advancement of education in the arts, science and technology by the establishment and maintenance of facilities for the residents of Southampton and the neighbourhood, without distinction of sex, sexual orientation, race or of political, religious or other opinions.</p>
<p>Nothing in this constitution shall authorise an application of the property of the CIO for the purposes which are not charitable.</p></li>
<li><p>Powers</p>
<p>The CIO has power to do anything which is calculated to further its object or is conducive or incidental to doing so. In particular, the CIO's powers include power to:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>borrow money and to charge the whole or any part of its property as security for the repayment of the money borrowed. The CIO must comply as appropriate with sections 124 and 125 of the Charities Act 2011 if it wishes to mortgage land;</p></li>
<li><p>buy, take on lease or in exchange, hire or otherwise acquire any property and to maintain and equip it for use;</p></li>
<li><p>sell, lease or otherwise dispose of all or any part of the property belonging to the CIO. In exercising this power, the CIO must comply as appropriate with sections 117 and 119-123 of the Charities Act 2011;</p></li>
<li><p>employ and remunerate such staff as are necessary for carrying out the work of the CIO. The CIO may employ or remunerate a charity trustee only to the extent that it is permitted to do so by clause 6 (Benefits and payments to charity trustees and connected persons) and provided it complies with the conditions of those clauses;</p></li>
<li><p>deposit or invest funds, employ a professional fund-manager, and arrange for the investments or other property of the CIO to be held in the name of a nominee, in the same manner and subject to the same conditions as the trustees of a trust are permitted to do by the Trustee Act 2000;</p></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>Application of income and property</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>The income and property of the CIO must be applied solely towards the promotion of the objects.</p>
<ol type="a">
<li><p>A charity trustee is entitled to be reimbursed from the property of the CIO or may pay out of such property reasonable expenses properly incurred by him or her when acting on behalf of the CIO.</p></li>
<li><p>A charity trustee may benefit from trustee indemnity insurance cover purchased at the CIO's expense in accordance with, and subject to the conditions in, section 189 of the Charities Act 2011.</p></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>None of the income or property of the CIO may be paid or transferred directly or indirectly by way of dividend, bonus or otherwise by way of profit to any member of the CIO. This does not prevent a member who is not also a charity trustee receiving:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li><p>a benefit from the CIO as a beneficiary of the CIO;</p></li>
<li><p>reasonable and proper remuneration for any goods or services supplied to the CIO.</p></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>Nothing in this clause shall prevent a charity trustee or connected person receiving any benefit or payment which is authorised by Clause 6.</p></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>Benefits and payments to charity trustees and connected persons</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>General provisions</p>
<p>No charity trustee or connected person may:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li><p>buy or receive any goods or services from the CIO on terms preferential to those applicable to members of the public;</p></li>
<li><p>sell goods, services, or any interest in land to the CIO;</p></li>
<li><p>be employed by, or receive any remuneration from, the CIO;</p></li>
<li><p>receive any other financial benefit from the CIO;</p></li>
</ol>
<p>unless the payment or benefit is permitted by sub-clause (2) of this clause, or authorised by the court or the Charity Commission (&quot;the Commission&quot;). In this clause, a &quot;financial benefit&quot; means a benefit, direct or indirect, which is either money or has a monetary value.</p></li>
<li><p>Scope and powers permitting trustees' or connected persons' benefits</p>
<ol type="a">
<li><p>A charity trustee or connected person may receive a benefit from the CIO as a beneficiary of the CIO provided that it is available generally to the beneficiaries of the CIO.</p></li>
<li><p>A charity trustee or connected person may enter into a contract for the supply of services, or of goods that are supplied in connection with the provision of services, to the CIO where that is permitted in accordance with, and subject to the conditions in, section 185 to 188 of the Charities Act 2011.</p></li>
<li><p>Subject to sub-clause (3) of this clause a charity trustee or connected person may provide the CIO with goods that are not supplied in connection with services provided to the CIO by the charity trustee or connected person.</p></li>
<li><p>A charity trustee or connected person may receive interest on money lent to the CIO at a reasonable and proper rate which must be not more than the Bank of England bank rate (also known as the base rate).</p></li>
<li><p>A charity trustee or connected person may receive rent for premises let by the trustee or connected person to the CIO. The amount of the rent and the other terms of the lease must be reasonable and proper. The charity trustee concerned must withdraw from any meeting at which such a proposal or the rent or other terms of the lease are under discussion.</p></li>
<li><p>A charity trustee or connected person may take part in the normal trading and fundraising activities of the CIO on the same terms as members of the public.</p></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>Payment for supply of goods only – controls</p>
<p>The CIO and its charity trustees may only rely upon the authority provided by sub-clause (2)(c) of this clause if each of the following conditions is satisfied:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li><p>The amount or maximum amount of the payment for the goods is set out in a written agreement between the CIO and the charity trustee or connected person supplying the goods (&quot;the supplier&quot;).</p></li>
<li><p>The amount or maximum amount of the payment for the goods does not exceed what is reasonable in the circumstances for the supply of the goods in question.</p></li>
<li><p>The other charity trustees are satisfied that it is in the best interests of the CIO to contract with the supplier rather than with someone who is not a charity trustee or connected person. In reaching that decision the charity trustees must balance the advantage of contracting with a charity trustee or connected person against the disadvantages of doing so.</p></li>
<li><p>The supplier is absent from the part of any meeting at which there is discussion of the proposal to enter into a contract or arrangement with him or her or it with regard to the supply of goods to the CIO.</p></li>
<li><p>The supplier does not vote on any such matter and is not to be counted when calculating whether a quorum of charity trustees is present at the meeting.</p></li>
<li><p>The reason for their decision is recorded by the charity trustees in the minute book.</p></li>
<li><p>A majority of the charity trustees then in office are not in receipt of remuneration or payments authorised by clause 6.</p></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>In sub-clauses (2) and (3) of this clause:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li><p>&quot;the CIO&quot; includes any company in which the CIO:</p>
<ol type="i">
<li><p>holds more than 50% of the shares; or</p></li>
<li><p>controls more than 50% of the voting rights attached to the shares; or</p></li>
<li><p>has the right to appoint one or more directors to the board of the company;</p></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>&quot;connected person&quot; includes any person within the definition set out in clause [28] (Interpretation);</p></li>
</ol></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>Conflicts of interest and conflicts of loyalty</p>
<p>A charity trustee must:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>declare the nature and extent of any interest, direct or indirect, which he or she has in a proposed transaction or arrangement with the CIO or in any transaction or arrangement entered into by the CIO which has not previously been declared; and</p></li>
<li><p>absent himself or herself from any discussions of the charity trustees in which it is possible that a conflict of interest will arise between his or her duty to act solely in the interests of the CIO and any personal interest (including but not limited to any financial interest).</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Any charity trustee absenting himself or herself from any discussions in accordance with this clause must not vote or be counted as part of the quorum in any decision of the charity trustees on the matter.</p></li>
<li><p>Liability of members to contribute to the assets of the CIO if it is wound up</p>
<p>If the CIO is wound up, the members of the CIO have no liability to contribute to its assets and no personal responsibility for settling its debts and liabilities.</p></li>
<li><p>Membership of the CIO</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Admission of new members</p>
<ol type="a">
<li><p>Eligibility</p>
<p>Membership of the CIO is open to anyone who is interested in furthering its purposes, and who, by applying for membership, has indicated his, her or its agreement to become a member and acceptance of the duty of members set out in sub-clause (3) of this clause.</p>
<p>A member may be an individual, a corporate body, or an individual or corporate body representing an organisation which is not incorporated.</p></li>
<li><p>Admission procedure</p>
<p>The charity trustees :</p>
<ol type="i">
<li><p>may require applications for membership to be made in any reasonable way that they decide;</p></li>
<li><p>shall, if they approve an application for membership, notify the applicant of their decision within 21 days;</p></li>
<li><p>may refuse an application for membership if they believe that it is in the best interests of the CIO for them to do so;</p></li>
<li><p>shall, if they decide to refuse an application for membership, give the applicant their reasons for doing so, within 21 days of the decision being taken, and give the applicant the opportunity to appeal against the refusal; and</p></li>
<li><p>shall give fair consideration to any such appeal, and shall inform the applicant of their decision, but any decision to confirm refusal of the application for membership shall be final.</p></li>
</ol></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>Transfer of membership</p>
<p>Membership of the CIO cannot be transferred to anyone else except in the case of an individual or corporate body representing an organisation which is not incorporated, whose membership may be transferred by the unincorporated organisation to a new representative. Such transfer of membership does not take effect until the CIO has received written notification of the transfer.</p></li>
<li><p>Duty of members</p>
<p>It is the duty of each member of the CIO to exercise his or her powers as a member of the CIO in the way he or she decides in good faith would be most likely to further the purposes of the CIO.</p></li>
<li><p>Termination of membership</p>
<ol type="a">
<li><p>Membership of the CIO comes to an end if :</p>
<ol type="i">
<li><p>the member dies, or, in the case of an organisation (or the representative of an organisation) that organisation ceases to exist; or</p></li>
<li><p>the member sends a notice of resignation to the charity trustees; or</p></li>
<li><p>any sum of money owed by the member to the CIO is not paid in full within six months of its falling due; or</p></li>
<li><p>the charity trustees decide that it is in the best interests of the CIO that the member in question should be removed from membership, and pass a resolution to that effect.</p></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>Before the charity trustees take any decision to remove someone from membership of the CIO they must :</p>
<ol type="i">
<li><p>inform the member of the reasons why it is proposed to remove him, her or it from membership;</p></li>
<li><p>give the member at least 21 clear days notice in which to make representations to the charity trustees as to why he, she or it should not be removed from membership;</p></li>
<li><p>at a duly constituted meeting of the charity trustees, consider whether or not the member should be removed from membership;</p></li>
<li><p>consider at that meeting any representations which the member makes as to why the member should not be removed; and</p></li>
<li><p>allow the member, or the member's representative, to make those representations in person at that meeting, if the member so chooses.</p></li>
</ol></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>Membership fees</p>
<p>The CIO may require members to pay reasonable membership fees to the CIO</p></li>
<li><p>Informal or associate (non-voting) membership</p>
<ol type="a">
<li><p>The charity trustees may create associate or other classes of non-voting membership, and may determine the rights and obligations of any such members (including payment of membership fees), and the conditions for admission to, and termination of membership of any such class of members.</p></li>
<li><p>Other references in this constitution to &quot;members&quot; and &quot;membership&quot; do not apply to non-voting members, and non-voting members do not qualify as members for any purpose under the Charities Acts, General Regulations or Dissolution Regulations.</p></li>
</ol></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>Members' decisions</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>General provisions</p>
<p>Except for those decisions that must be taken in a particular way as indicated in sub-clause (4) of this clause, decisions of the members of the CIO may be taken either by vote at a general meeting as provided in sub-clause (2) of this clause or by written resolution as provided in sub-clause (3) of this clause.</p></li>
<li><p>Taking ordinary decisions by vote</p>
<p>Subject to sub-clause (4) of this clause, any decision of the members of the CIO may be taken by means of a resolution at a general meeting. Such a resolution may be passed by a simple majority of votes cast at the meeting (including votes cast by postal or email ballot, and proxy votes).</p></li>
<li><p>Taking ordinary decisions by written resolution without a general meeting</p>
<ol type="a">
<li><p>Subject to sub-clause (4) of this clause, a resolution in writing agreed by a simple majority of all the members who would have been entitled to vote upon it had it been proposed at a general meeting shall be effective, provided that:</p>
<ol type="i">
<li><p>a copy of the proposed resolution has been sent to all the members eligible to vote; and</p></li>
<li><p>a simple majority of members has signified its agreement to the resolution in a document or documents which are received at the principal office within the period of 28 days beginning with the circulation date. The document signifying a member's agreement must be authenticated by their signature (or in the case of an organisation which is a member, by execution according to its usual procedure), by a statement of their identity accompanying the document, or in such other manner as the CIO has specified.</p></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>The resolution in writing may comprise several copies to which one or more members has signified their agreement.</p></li>
<li><p>Eligibility to vote on the resolution is limited to members who are members of the CIO on the date when the proposal is first circulated in accordance with paragraph (a) above.</p></li>
<li><p>Not less than 10% of the members of the CIO may request the charity trustees to make a proposal for decision by the members.</p></li>
<li><p>The charity trustees must within 21 days of receiving such a request comply with it if :</p>
<ol type="i">
<li><p>The proposal is not frivolous or vexatious, and does not involve the publication of defamatory material;</p></li>
<li><p>The proposal is stated with sufficient clarity to enable effect to be given to it if it is agreed by the members; and</p></li>
<li><p>Effect can lawfully be given to the proposal if it is so agreed.</p></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>Sub-clauses (a) to (c) of this clause apply to a proposal made at the request of members.</p></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>Decisions that must be taken in a particular way</p>
<ol type="a">
<li><p>Any decision to remove a trustee must be taken in accordance with clause [15(2)].</p></li>
<li><p>Any decision to amend this constitution must be taken in accordance with clause [28] of this constitution (Amendment of Constitution).</p></li>
<li><p>Any decision to wind up or dissolve the CIO must be taken in accordance with clause [29] of this constitution (Voluntary winding up or dissolution). Any decision to amalgamate or transfer the undertaking of the CIO to one or more other CIOs must be taken in accordance with the provisions of the Charities Act 2011.</p></li>
</ol></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>General meetings of members</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Types of general meeting</p>
<p>There must be an annual general meeting (AGM) of the members of the CIO. The first AGM must be held within 18 months of the registration of the CIO, and subsequent AGMs must be held at intervals of not more than 15 months. The AGM must receive the annual statement of accounts (duly audited or examined where applicable) and the trustees' annual report, and must elect trustees as required under clause [13].</p>
<p>Other general meetings of the members of the CIO may be held at any time.</p>
<p>All general meetings must be held in accordance with the following provisions.</p></li>
<li><p>Calling general meetings</p>
<ol type="a">
<li><p>The charity trustees :</p>
<ol type="i">
<li><p>must call the annual general meeting of the members of the CIO in accordance with sub-clause (1) of this clause, and identify it as such in the notice of the meeting; and</p></li>
<li><p>may call any other general meeting of the members at any time.</p></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>The charity trustees must, within 21 days, call a general meeting of the members of the CIO if :</p>
<ol type="i">
<li><p>they receive a request to do so from at least 10% of the members of the CIO; and</p></li>
<li><p>the request states the general nature of the business to be dealt with at the meeting, and is authenticated by the member(s) making the request.</p></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>If, at the time of any such request, there has not been any general meeting of the members of the CIO for more than 12 months, then sub-clause (b)(i) of this clause shall have effect as if 5% were substituted for 10%.</p></li>
<li><p>Any such request may include particulars of a resolution that may properly be proposed, and is intended to be proposed, at the meeting.</p></li>
<li><p>A resolution may only properly be proposed if it is lawful, and is not defamatory, frivolous or vexatious.</p></li>
<li><p>Any general meeting called by the charity trustees at the request of the members of the CIO must be held within 28 days from the date on which it is called.</p></li>
<li><p>If the charity trustees fail to comply with this obligation to call a general meeting at the request of its members, then the members who requested the meeting may themselves call a general meeting.</p></li>
<li><p>A general meeting called in this way must be held not more than 3 months after the date when the members first requested the meeting.</p></li>
<li><p>The CIO must reimburse any reasonable expenses incurred by the members calling a general meeting by reason of the failure of the charity trustees to duly call the meeting, but the CIO shall be entitled to be indemnified by the charity trustees who were responsible for such failure.</p></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>Notice of general meetings</p>
<ol type="a">
<li><p>The charity trustees, or, as the case may be, the relevant members of the CIO, must give at least 14 clear days notice of any general meeting to all of the members, and to any charity trustee of the CIO who is not a member.</p></li>
<li><p>If it is agreed by not less than 90% of all members of the CIO, any resolution may be proposed and passed at the meeting even though the requirements of sub-clause (3) (a) of this clause have not been met. This sub-clause does not apply where a specified period of notice is strictly required by another clause in this constitution, by the Charities Act 2011 or by the General Regulations.</p></li>
<li><p>The notice of any general meeting must :</p>
<ol type="i">
<li><p>state the time and date of the meeting:</p></li>
<li><p>give the address at which the meeting is to take place;</p></li>
<li><p>give particulars of any resolution which is to be moved at the meeting, and of the general nature of any other business to be dealt with at the meeting; and</p></li>
<li><p>if a proposal to alter the constitution of the CIO is to be considered at the meeting, include the text of the proposed alteration;</p></li>
<li><p>include, with the notice for the AGM, the annual statement of accounts and trustees' annual report, details of persons standing for election or re- election as trustee, or where allowed under clause [21] (Use of electronic communication), details of where the information may be found on the CIO's website.</p></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>Proof that an envelope containing a notice was properly addressed, prepaid and posted; or that an electronic form of notice was properly addressed and sent, shall be conclusive evidence that the notice was given. Notice shall be deemed to be given 48 hours after it was posted or sent.</p></li>
<li><p>The proceedings of a meeting shall not be invalidated because a member who was entitled to receive notice of the meeting did not receive it because of accidental omission by the CIO.</p></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>Chairing of general meetings</p>
<p>The person nominated as chair by the charity trustees under clause <a href="2">19</a> (Chairing of meetings), shall, if present at the general meeting and willing to act, preside as chair of the meeting. Subject to that, the members of the CIO who are present at a general meeting shall elect a chair to preside at the meeting.</p></li>
<li><p>Quorum at general meetings</p>
<ol type="a">
<li><p>No business may be transacted at any general meeting of the members of the CIO unless a quorum is present when the meeting starts.</p></li>
<li><p>Subject to the following provisions, the quorum for general meetings shall be the greater of 5% or three members. An organisation represented by a person present at the meeting in accordance with sub-clause (7) of this clause, is counted as being present in person.</p></li>
<li><p>If the meeting has been called by or at the request of the members and a quorum is not present within 15 minutes of the starting time specified in the notice of the meeting, the meeting is closed.</p></li>
<li><p>If the meeting has been called in any other way and a quorum is not present within 15 minutes of the starting time specified in the notice of the meeting, the chair must adjourn the meeting. The date, time and place at which the meeting will resume must either be announced by the chair or be notified to the CIO's members at least seven clear days before the date on which it will resume.</p></li>
<li><p>If a quorum is not present within 15 minutes of the start time of the adjourned meeting, the member or members present at the meeting constitute a quorum.</p></li>
<li><p>If at any time during the meeting a quorum ceases to be present, the meeting may discuss issues and make recommendations to the trustees but may not make any decisions. If decisions are required which must be made by a meeting of the members, the meeting must be adjourned.</p></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>Voting at general meetings</p>
<ol type="a">
<li><p>Any decision other than one falling within clause [10(4)] (Decisions that must be taken in a particular way) shall be taken by a simple majority of votes cast at the meeting (including proxy and postal votes). Every member has one vote.</p></li>
<li><p>A resolution put to the vote of a meeting shall be decided on a show of hands, unless (before or on the declaration of the result of the show of hands) a poll is duly demanded. A poll may be demanded by the chair or by at least 10% of the members present in person or by proxy at the meeting.</p></li>
<li><p>A poll demanded on the election of a person to chair the meeting or on a question of adjournment must be taken immediately. A poll on any other matter shall be taken, and the result of the poll shall be announced, in such manner as the chair of the meeting shall decide, provided that the poll must be taken, and the result of the poll announced, within 30 days of the demand for the poll.</p></li>
<li><p>A poll may be taken :</p>
<ol type="i">
<li><p>at the meeting at which it was demanded; or</p></li>
<li><p>at some other time and place specified by the chair; or</p></li>
<li><p>through the use of postal or electronic communications.</p></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>In the event of an equality of votes, whether on a show of hands or on a poll, the chair of the meeting shall have a second, or casting vote.</p></li>
<li><p>Any objection to the qualification of any voter must be raised at the meeting at which the vote is cast and the decision of the chair of the meeting shall be final.</p></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>Representation of organisations and corporate members</p>
<p>An organisation or a corporate body that is a member of the CIO may, in accordance with its usual decision-making process, authorise a person to act as its representative at any general meeting of the CIO.</p>
<p>The representative is entitled to exercise the same powers on behalf of the organisation or corporate body as the organisation or corporate body could exercise as an individual member of the CIO.</p></li>
<li><p>Adjournment of meetings</p>
<p>The chair may with the consent of a meeting at which a quorum is present (and shall if so directed by the meeting) adjourn the meeting to another time and/or place. No business may be transacted at an adjourned meeting except business which could properly have been transacted at the original meeting.</p></li>
<li><p>Proxy voting</p>
<ol type="a">
<li><p>Any member of the CIO may appoint another person as a proxy to exercise all or any of that member's rights to attend, speak and vote at a general meeting of the CIO. Proxies must be appointed by a notice in writing (a &quot;proxy notice&quot;) which:</p>
<ol type="i">
<li><p>states the name and address of the member appointing the proxy;</p></li>
<li><p>identifies the person appointed to be that member's proxy and the general meeting in relation to which that person is appointed;</p></li>
<li><p>is signed by or on behalf of the member appointing the proxy, or is authenticated in such manner as the CIO may determine; and</p></li>
<li><p>is delivered to the CIO in accordance with the constitution and any instructions contained in the notice of the general meeting to which they relate.</p></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>The CIO may require proxy notices to be delivered in a particular form, and may specify different forms for different purposes.</p></li>
<li><p>Proxy notices may (but do not have to) specify how the proxy appointed under them is to vote (or that the proxy is to abstain from voting) on one or more resolutions.</p></li>
<li><p>Unless a proxy notice indicates otherwise, it must be treated as :</p>
<ol type="i">
<li><p>allowing the person appointed under it as a proxy discretion as to how to vote on any ancillary or procedural resolutions put to the meeting; and</p></li>
<li><p>appointing that person as a proxy in relation to any adjournment of the general meeting to which it relates as well as the meeting itself.</p></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>A member who is entitled to attend, speak or vote (either on a show of hands or on a poll) at a general meeting remains so entitled in respect of that meeting or any adjournment of it, even though a valid proxy notice has been delivered to the CIO by or on behalf of that member.</p></li>
<li><p>An appointment under a proxy notice may be revoked by delivering to the CIO a notice in writing given by or on behalf of the member by whom or on whose behalf the proxy notice was given.</p></li>
<li><p>A notice revoking a proxy appointment only takes effect if it is delivered before the start of the meeting or adjourned meeting to which it relates.</p></li>
<li><p>If a proxy notice is not signed or authenticated by the member appointing the proxy, it must be accompanied by written evidence that the person who signed or authenticated it on that member's behalf had authority to do so.</p></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>Postal Voting</p>
<ol type="a">
<li><p>The CIO may, if the charity trustees so decide, allow the members to vote by post or electronic mail (&quot;email&quot;) to elect charity trustees or to make a decision on any matter that is being decided at a general meeting of the members.</p></li>
<li><p>The charity trustees must appoint at least two persons independent of the CIO to serve as scrutineers to supervise the conduct of the postal/email ballot and the counting of votes.</p></li>
<li><p>If postal and/or email voting is to be allowed on a matter, the CIO must send to members of the CIO not less than [21] days before the deadline for receipt of votes cast in this way:</p>

<li><p>a notice by email, if the member has agreed to receive notices in this way under clause [21] (Use of electronic communication, including an explanation of the purpose of the vote and the voting procedure to be followed by the member, and a voting form capable of being returned by email or post to the CIO, containing details of the resolution being put to a vote, or of the candidates for election, as applicable;</p></li>
<li><p>a notice by post to all other members, including a written explanation of the purpose of the postal vote and the voting procedure to be followed by the member; and a postal voting form containing details of the resolution being put to a vote, or of the candidates for election, as applicable.</p></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>The voting procedure must require all forms returned by post to be in an envelope with the member's name and signature, and nothing else, on the outside, inside another envelope addressed to 'The Scrutineers for So Make It', at the CIO's principal office or such other postal address as is specified in the voting procedure.</p></li>
<li><p>The voting procedure for votes cast by email must require the member's name to be at the top of the email, and the email must be authenticated in the manner specified in the voting procedure.</p></li>
<li><p>Email votes must be returned to an email address used only for this purpose and must be accessed only by a scrutineer.</p></li>
<li><p>The voting procedure must specify the closing date and time for receipt of votes, and must state that any votes received after the closing date or not complying with the voting procedure will be invalid and not be counted.</p></li>
<li><p>The scrutineers must make a list of names of members casting valid votes, and a separate list of members casting votes which were invalid. These lists must be provided to a charity trustee or other person overseeing admission to, and voting at, the general meeting. A member who has cast a valid postal or email vote must not vote at the meeting, and must not be counted in the quorum for any part of the meeting on which he, she or it has already cast a valid vote. A member who has cast an invalid vote by post or email is allowed to vote at the meeting and counts towards the quorum.</p>
<ol type="i">
<li>For postal votes, the scrutineers must retain the internal envelopes (with the member's name and signature). For email votes, the scrutineers must cut off and retain any part of the email that includes the member's name.

<li><p>The scrutineers must not disclose the result of the postal/email ballot until after votes taken by hand or by poll at the meeting, or by poll after the meeting, have been counted. Only at this point shall the scrutineers declare the result of the valid votes received, and these votes shall be included in the declaration of the result of the vote.</p></li>
<li><p>Following the final declaration of the result of the vote, the scrutineers must provide to a charity trustee or other authorised person bundles containing the evidence of members submitting valid postal votes; evidence of members submitting valid email votes; evidence of invalid votes; the valid votes; and the invalid votes.</p></li>
<li><p>Any dispute about the conduct of a postal or email ballot must be referred initially to a panel set up by the charity trustees, to consist of two trustees and two persons independent of the CIO. If the dispute cannot be satisfactorily resolved by the panel, it must be referred to the Electoral Reform Society.</p></li>
